            <h2>üìú Manifesto</h2>
            <p>
                Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.

            <p>
                The parallax effect has been around for years in classic video games, but it became a trend in the web design world. This cool effect is now commonly seen as part of the scrolling feature of a web page. It uses multiple backgrounds which seem to move at different speeds to create a sensation of depth (creating a faux-3D effect) and an interesting browsing experience.
                Prerequisites:A basic knowledge of JavaScript and React,Node.js installed and Npm or yarn installed.

            <p>
                Three.js is a JavaScript framework that allows you to quickly build a 3D or 2D graphic on your web page. With Three.js, we don‚Äôt have to use WebGL directly. It‚Äôs an abstract layer built on WebGL to make it easier to use. Anyone can use a web browser to view 3D graphics without downloading any extra framework.
                Since Three.js is built on JavaScript, adding interactivity between 3D objects and user interfaces is quite simple. This makes Three.js ideal for creating 3D games on the web platform. It also offers exceptional features such as effects, scenes, cameras, etc.
                Vite is a modern, lightning-fast tool for scaffolding and project-bundling. It is quickly gaining traction due to its near-instant code compilation and rapid hot module replacement. It is a JavaScript development server that greatly enhances the frontend development experience. As a result, we can call it a development tool.
                It converts your code into something that your browser can understand. Vite allows you to run a development server. It also handles and updates your files based on changes. This process is completed quickly in order to reflect your changes on the browser.

            <h2>üåÆ Languages Used</h2>

            <h3>HTML</h3>
            <p>
                HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.
            </p>
            <h3>JavaScript</h3>
            <p>
                JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user. 
            </p>
            <h3>CSS</h3>
            <p>
                CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language. The separation of HTML from CSS makes it easier to maintain sites, share style sheets across pages, and tailor pages to different environments. This is referred to as the separation of structure
